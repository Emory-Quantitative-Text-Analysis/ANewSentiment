NEGRO LYNCHED FOR DEATH OF FARMERMob Wins in Race With Officers to Reach the Black.RIDDLED WITH BULLETSTells Victim’s Wife of Crime and Threatens Her Life.	Macon, Ga., Feb. 12. – Marvin Harris, a negro was lynched in Twiggs county to-day, according to news received here tonight, as a result of his alleged murder of S. A. Fountain, prominent farmer of Wilkinson county.  The negro was 21 years old. The farmer was 60 years old.	Fountain was shot yesterday while he was plowing a field near the Wilkinson – Twiggs county line.	The negro Harris then is alleged to have walked to the home of the farmer and told Mrs. Fountain what he had done. According to the farmer’s wife the negro threatened her life if she told anyone what he had done.	The woman was badly frightened by the negro, and she only told the neighbors late in the evening that her husband had not returned from the field. A search was begun and the body was found at 10 o’clock last night. There were several bullet holes in his body.	At the coroner’s inquest this morning Mrs. Fountain told how the negro had told her of this crime and how he had threatened her.  	A mob of men quickly formed, and though officers tried to reach the negro first, the mob leaders won the race and hanged Harris to the limb of a tree. The body was riddled with bullets, the head being literally shot to pieces with pistol bullets.	The negro is said to have confessed to his crime and admitted that Mrs. Fountain’s story was correct before he was executed by the mob. The negro’s family refused to take his body and the county will bury it.	Mrs. Fountain said that the negro told her that he lost his temper in an argument with her husband over a plowboy, whose work did not suit the farmer. Fountain was unarmed and when the negro approached him with a revolver he started to run. The negro then said he shot the farmer, and as fountain fell he fired several more times into the body.
